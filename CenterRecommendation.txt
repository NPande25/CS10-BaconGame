Problem Set 4
Nikhil Pande and Nathan McAllister

We believe that a proper center of the acting universe should be someone with a very low average separation, which can be
calculated with our function. This characteristic maximizes efficiency because people take, on average, a smaller number
of steps to reach the center. Gene Hackman, whose average separation is about 3.06, would be an example of a good
center of the universe. On the other hand, Bernhard Goetzke, whose average separation is about 8.68, would be a poor
center of the universe, for most actors have many degrees of separation from him. In comparison to Kevin Bacon, whose
average separation is 3.28, Gene Hackman would be a much better center of the universe.
